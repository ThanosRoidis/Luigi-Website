		<p>Luigi (Japanese ルイージ, Ruīji) is the younger and taller brother of Mario from the Mario series
		 and the deuteragonist of some of the series' titles. Making an appearance in almost every Mario game
		  and starring in three games, as the main protagonist, over time he has become a well known character. 
		  His role in games appears to be a deuteragonist to his older brother, Mario. He never seems to like going
		 on adventures without Mario. In some games, usually in the Mario and Luigi RPG series, Luigi is simply
	      referred to by enemies as "Mr. Green Hat" and other generic names, making him out to be somewhat unnoticed
          by Bowser and his minions. For example, in the Super Mario Galaxy series, if Luigi shows up at the final
	      battle with Bowser instead of Mario, Bowser will be surprised that Luigi has come instead of Mario, who
	     he is used to fighting. Other than his color being green, he was planned to be exactly like Mario, but
	      as his popularity grew, he developed a personality and style of his own. His jumping ability surpasses
		     Mario's by far and he is normally depicted as cowardly and scrawny, but when he does get the courage
		     to step up, he can be tough and overcome his fears. He seems to like Princess Daisy. Luigi is voiced
	        by Charles Martinet.</p>
